# Simple Calculator in C

This is a console-based simple calculator program written in C that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers provided by the user. It includes input validation to ensure proper operator selection and checks for division by zero to avoid errors.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the `emycodes.c` file to your local machine.

2. Compile the C code using a C compiler (e.g., GCC) with the following command: 

   ```bash
   gcc emycodes.c -o emycodes
   ```
3. Symbol Representation:
   
   **Addition**         -    `+`

   **Subtraction**      -    `-`

   **Multiplication**   -    `*`

   **Division**         -    `/`

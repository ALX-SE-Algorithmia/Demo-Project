#Basic Calculator

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide an opportunity for everyone to enhance their knowledge of the C programming language. It also serves as a demonstration of collaboration skills for future projects.

## Features
- User-friendly prompt: The program displays a clear and concise prompt to guide users in entering their arithmetic expression.
- Error handling: The program handles invalid input from the user, such as non-numeric values or invalid operators. It displays an error message and prompts the user to enter valid input.

## Getting Started
To use this program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from the following link: Demo Project Repository.
2. Change Directory to **`KabzaKole`**

# ALX SE Algorithmia Demo Project
## Basic Calculator

The Basic Calculator C implementation is a simple command-line calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator takes user input and displays the result of the specified operation.

## AIM

This project aims to provide an easy-to-understand example of how to build a basic calculator using C. It is a great starting point for people learning C programming and looking to practice fundamental concepts, such as functions, control flow, and user input.

## Operations

This are the following operations that can be performed with this calculator:

- Addition: Perform addition of two numbers.
- Subtraction: Perform subtraction of two numbers.
- Multiplication: Perform multiplication of two numbers.
- Division: Perform division of two numbers.

## Usage

Using this program run the following commands in your terminal:

* Clone the Demo-Project repository using this command `git clone <link to Demo-Project repository> `
* Change Directory to `samuelejalonibu` using this command `cd samuelejalonibu`
* Compile the program using C compiler, use this command ` gcc *.c -o calculator`
* Run the compiled executable using this command `./calculator`
* Enter two numbers and an arithmetic operator when asked
* Then you'll see your result

## Example

Here is an example of how to use the calculator:

```
Welcome to the Basic Calculator!
Choose an operation:

1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
Enter your operator: +

Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 20

Result: 10 + 20 = 30
```

Feel free to try out different operations and numbers to explore the calculator's functionality.

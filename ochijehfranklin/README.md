This is my contribution to the Algorithmia Open Source Demo Project.

This directory contains my solution for the basic C calculator.

This calculator is built in C, and performs basic arithmetic calculations:
+ Addition
+ Subtraction
+ Division      and
+ Subtraction

This calculator takes in two numbers and an arithmetic operator (any of + , - , * and / ) as standard input from the user, and returns the result of the arithmetic operation.

It also handles errors from the user:
+ Wrong input when called for numbers
+ Invalid arithmetic operator

To use this calculator:
1. Clone this repo:     `git clone https://github.com/ALX-SE-Algorithmia/Demo-Project/`
2. Navigate into this directory:   `cd ochijehfranklin`
3. Run this command:     `gcc calculator.c -o calculator ; ./calculator`

# Simple Calculator

This is a program implemented in the C programming language. However, it can be implemented in other programming languages. This program allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Additional features, such as trigonometric functions like sine, cosine, and tangent, will be implemented in the future.

## Features

- *Addition:* Perform addition of two numbers.
- *Subtraction:* Perform subtraction of two numbers.
- *Multiplication:* Perform multiplication of two numbers.
- *Division:* Perform division of two numbers.
- *Trigonometric functions:* Additional trigonometric functions like sine, cosine, and tangent will be implemented.

## Prerequisites

- *C compiler:* Make sure you have a C compiler installed on your system (e.g., GCC, Clang, etc.). If you are using a different programming language, ensure you have the appropriate compiler or interpreter installed.

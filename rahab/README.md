# collaborating on Calculator Demo project in c programming
The Demo will run like a calculator which will handle 4 operation
	.Addition
	.Substraction
	.Multiplication
	.Division

#Program contain 4 functions
	.Addition function
	.Multiplication function
	.Substraction function
	.Division function

#Calculator is interactive
	.It takes in two numbers from the user
	.It takes in an arithmetic operator for the four math operation
	.Perform arthmetic operationbased on user choice
	.Then it's prints result when user entered valid operator
	.When user enter wrong arthmetic operation other than division, addition,multiplication and addition
	.program warn user then print an error message.

#The program allow user to use calculator many time
.After performing one operation user will be asked if he/she want to contiue
	.if user select y(for yes) or Y(for capital Yes)user can keep using the calculator
	.if user select other character or typed anything rather than Y or y the program will end.

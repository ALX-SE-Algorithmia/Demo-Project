# Bett's bmi calculator
This is my implementation of a simple bmi calc
BMI refers to:
           B - Body
           M - Mass
           I - Index
 

In the code , we use 'printf' function to prompt the user to enter their weight and height. The 'scanf' function is used to read the user's input and store it in the 'weight' and 'height' variables respectively


Then, the BMI is calculated by dividing the weight (in kilograms) by the square of the height(in meters). The result is stored in the 'bmi' variable

Finally, we use the 'printf' function to again display the calculated BMI to the user, with a prescision to two decimal places

the code ends by returning 0 to indicate a successful execution

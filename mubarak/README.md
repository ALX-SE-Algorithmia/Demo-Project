        - Subtraction
        - Multiplication
        - Division

# Requirement
        1. It takes in two numbers from the user (standard input)
        2. It takes in an arithmetic operator for the four math operations ( ‘+’ for Addition, ‘-’ for subtraction, ‘/’ for division, and ‘*’ for multiplication )
        3. It performs an arithmetic operation based on the arithmetic operator that the user passes in.
        4. It prints the result to the screen.
        5. If the user enters a wrong arithmetic operator other than the one we are using or does not enter correct numbers, your C program will print an error to the screen.

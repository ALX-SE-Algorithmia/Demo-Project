# Basic Calculator
This project is a simple calculator program implemented in C. It allows users to perform arithmetic operations by entering two numbers and an arithmetic operator. The program will then calculate the result based on the operator entered.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide an opportunity for everyone to enhance their knowledge of the C programming language. It also serves as a demonstration of collaboration skills for future projects.

## Features
- User-friendly prompt: The program displays a clear and concise prompt to guide users in entering their arithmetic expression.
- Error handling: The program handles invalid input from the user, such as non-numeric values or invalid operators. It displays an error message and prompts the user to enter valid input.

## Getting Started
To use this program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from the following link: Demo Project Repository.
2. Change Directory to **`DestinedCodes-c`**
3. Compile the program using a C compiler. Example:` gcc *.c -o calc`
4. Run the compiled executable (`./calc`).
5. Enter two numbers and an arithmetic operator when prompted.
6. View the calculated result.

## Example
```
Enter a simple arithmetic expression. Example: 23 * 5
(allowed operators: +, -, *, or /)
=> 12.5 * 4.2
Result: 52.50
```

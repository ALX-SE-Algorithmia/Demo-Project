# Demo Project (Build Collaboration Skills 👩‍💻👨‍💻🎧)
Our first demo project we will be working on together, to test collaboration skills.

And everyone can contribute toward to the development of this organisation.

We will build a calculator in C and any other language of each individual's choice.

     - From the base of the repository on your local machine, run this command:

       `` git checkout -b yourBranchName ``
       
      - Replace 'yourBranchName' with your branch name.
4. Work from your branch. <strong><em>Never work on the main branch, please.</em></strong>
5. In your branch, create two directories: C and the name of the other language you are using.
6. Add your solutions and use appropriate commit messages.
7. Push your solution to your branch using the command:

   `` git push origin yourBranchName ``
       
      - Again, don't forget to replace 'yourBranchName' with your branch name.

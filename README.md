# Demo Project - Calculator

Welcome to our first demo project aimed at testing collaboration skills. In this project, we will build a basic calculator in C and any other programming language of your choice. The goal is to enhance your knowledge of the C programming language while demonstrating effective collaboration for future projects.

## Project Description
The calculator program allows users to perform arithmetic operations by entering two numbers and an arithmetic operator. The program then calculates the result based on the provided operator.

## Features
- User-friendly prompt: The program provides clear instructions and prompts to guide users in entering their arithmetic expressions.
- Error handling: The program handles invalid input, such as non-numeric values or invalid operators, by displaying error messages and prompting the user to enter valid input.
- Decimal precision: The program supports calculations with decimal numbers, allowing users to specify the number of decimal places to round the result or enter decimal numbers directly.

## Getting Started
To use this calculator program, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ALX-SE-Algorithmia/Demo-Project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Demo-Project
   ```

3. Navigate to any of the contributor's directory:
   ```
   cd <username>-<lang>
   ```

4. Open the calculator program file (`calc.c` or the respective file for your chosen programming language) in your preferred code editor.

5. Compile the program using a compatible compiler.
eg. gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -lm

6. Run the compiled executable.

7. Enter two numbers and an arithmetic operator when prompted.

8. View the calculated result.

## Example
Here is an example of using the calculator program:

```
Enter a simple arithmetic expression. Example: 23 * 5
(allowed operators: +, -, *, or /)
=> 12.5 * 4.2
Result: 52.50
```

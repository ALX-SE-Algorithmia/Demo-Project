Algorithmia Demo-Project
Branch name:- Ruovagems
Contributor:- Ruovagems 

This is the first Demo-Project of Algorithmia
The project entails building a simple interactive calculator that takes in two numbers  and four basic arithemetic operations
● Addition
● Subtraction
● Multiplication and
● Division

In sunmary the basic interactive  calculator will 
1. Take in two numbers from the user (standard input)
2. Take  in an arithmetic operator for the four math
operations ( ‘+’ for Addition, ‘-’ for subtraction, ‘/’ for
division, and ‘*’ for multiplication )
3. perform an arithmetic operation based on the
arithmetic operator that the user passes in.
4. print the result to the screen.
5. If the user enters a wrong arithmetic operator other than
the one we are using or does not enter correct numbers, your C program will print an error to the screen.

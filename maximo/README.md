Implementation of a simple Calculator in C programming.

This is my implementation of the calculator. It performs a simple opeeration like multplication, division, subtraction and addition.

Example

    $ gcc *.c -o cal
    $ ./cal
    Enter an operator(-, +, *, /): *

    Enter number1: 7

    Enter number2: 6

    result is: 13.00
